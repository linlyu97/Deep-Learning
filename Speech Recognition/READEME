Established a Multilayer Perceptron model using PyTorch for speech classification, by changing the baseline deeper and wider for enhancing the prediction accuracy on test data

Optimized model by adding a scheduler to decreasing learning rate over time, adding Batchnorm 1d and Droupout; 

Achieved a 30% increase in accuracy compared to baseline
