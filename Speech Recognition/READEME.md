Established a Multilayer Perceptron model using PyTorch for speech classification. 

## Tricks to enhance model performance:
1. By changing the baseline deeper and wider for enhancing the prediction accuracy on test data.

2. Optimized model by adding a scheduler to decreasing learning rate over time, adding Batchnorm 1d and Droupout; Achieved a 30% increase in accuracy compared to baseline.
