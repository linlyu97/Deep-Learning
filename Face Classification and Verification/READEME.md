•	Built a ResNet model by adding skip connections as more as possible; used classification train data to train the model
•	Applied center loss as loss criterion and used data augmentation by random horizontal flipping or random vertical flipping the raw pictures in order to improve performance on classification validation data.
•	Calculated cosine similarity through verification data face embedding pairs and used AUC score to evaluate the model performance for face verification; ranked 26/84 in Kaggle competition
